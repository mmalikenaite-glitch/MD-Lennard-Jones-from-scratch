    "3. **Automatic Installation:** You can run the Bootstrap Cell below to install required packages such as Numba.\n",
    "4. **Why Numba?** Molecular Dynamics simulations often involve nested loops to calculate forces between every pair of particles. In standard Python, these loops are slow because the code is interpreted line-by-line. To speed these loops up, we use **Numba**:\n",
    "   * Numba is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for Python\n",
    "   * It translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code at runtime\n",
    "   * In this exercise, we use the `@njit` decorator to achieve performance comparable to C, allowing us to simulate hundreds of particles on a laptop within seconds\n",
    "   * The first time a function decorated with `@njit` runs, there will be a small delay (1–2 seconds) while Numba compiles the Python code into machine code"

    "## 9. Periodic Boundary Conditions & Minimum Image Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate a system at a specified density, we need boundaries. However, for small systems, interaction with physical walls would dominate the behavior. The solution is to use **Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC)**.\n",

    "### Conceptual Picture\n",
    "In PBC, the simulation box is periodically repeated in all directions, creating an infinite lattice of identical boxes. You only simulate one box, but:\n",
    "* When a particle exits one side of the box, it re-enters from the opposite side\n",
    "* Each particle interacts with particles in the central box and their periodic images\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Position Folding**\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep particles within the box $[0, L)$, apply periodic wrapping. For the $x$-coordinate (and similarly for $y$ and $z$):\n",
    "$$x_i := x_i - L \\cdot \\mathrm{floor}\\left( \\frac{x_i}{L} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Minimum Image Convention**\n",
    "\n",
    "With infinite periodic copies, each particle has infinitely many neighbors. We introduce a **cutoff distance** $r_c$ beyond which interactions are neglected. For the Lennard-Jones potential, a common choice is $r_c = 2.5\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the minimum image convention to work correctly, we require:\n",
    "$$L > 2 r_c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that particle $i$ can interact with at most one periodic image of particle $j$, namely, the closest one. To find the minimum image separation between particles $i$ and $j$, compute:\n",
    "$$x_{ij} = x_i - x_j$$\n",
    "$$x_{ij} := x_{ij} - L \\cdot \\mathrm{floor}\\left( \\frac{x_{ij}}{L} + 0.5 \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula shifts $x_{ij}$ to the range $[-L/2, L/2)$, giving the shortest distance considering periodic images.\n",

    "### Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create `min_image` function:** Implement a Numba-compiled function `min_image(r_vec, L)` that applies the minimum-image formula to a 3D displacement vector `r_vec`. After implementation, place this function **before** the definition of `compute_forces`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modify `compute_forces`:** \n",
    "   - Add `L` and `r_c` as input parameters (suggest `r_c=None` as default)\n",
    "   - For each pair, apply `min_image` to compute the minimum-image displacement $\\mathbf{r}_{ij}$\n",

    "   - If $r_{\\mathrm{sq}} > r_c^2$, skip the force computation using `continue`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create `fold_in_box` function:** Implement a function that folds particle coordinates back into the box after each integration step. Apply the folding formula to all particles at once (use NumPy vectorization). Note: It's computationally cheaper to blindly apply folding to all particles rather than checking which ones are out of bounds first.\n",
